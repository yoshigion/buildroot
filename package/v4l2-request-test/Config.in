	  This standalone tool was designed to help with development
	  and testing of the Cedrus driver, that supports the Video Engine
	  found on most Allwinner SoCs.
	  It implements the Linux v4l2 Request API, so it can help to test
	  any driver being developed using that API.

comment "v4l2-request-test needs a toolchain w/ threads, dynamic library"
